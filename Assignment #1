Example #1: If someone gets a positive test, it is "statistically significant
at the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?

Sample = 1000
False positive rate = 0.05
No False negative rate
WHO estimates of HIV prevalence of 0.6%, or 0.006 
Source: https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv-aids

True positives = 1000 * (0.6/100) = 6
False positives = 1000 * ((100-0.6)/100) * 0.05 = ~50

Remaining tests would be negative

Accuracy: 6/56 = 11%
